## Docker
Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the development, shipping, and running of applications using containers. 
Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that allow you to package an application with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Key Concept of Docker 
**1.Containers** 
   
   - Containers are isolated environments where applications run. They package the application along with its libraries, dependencies, and configuration files, ensuring that it runs consistently regardless of the host environment.
  
   - Containers share the same operating system kernel, making them lightweight and efficient compared to virtual machines.

**2.Docker Images**
 
   - A Docker image is a snapshot of an application and its dependencies. It is a read-only template that defines the environment in which the container runs.
   
   - Docker images are built using a Dockerfile, which contains a set of instructions on how to assemble the image.
